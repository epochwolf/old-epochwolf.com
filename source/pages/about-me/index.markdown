I'm a Ruby on Rails developer in Bothell, WA. Originally born in Chicago, IL and raised in Green Bay, WI.

I'm active in the [Seattle Rails Group](http://www.meetup.com/The-Seattle-Ruby-on-Rails-Developers-Meetup-Group/), which you can find me at Caf√© Racer most Monday nights. You can also find me virtually on irc.freenode.net. I hang out in the #rubyonrails chatroom. 

In high school and college I was interested in writing science fiction and fantasy. But, I'm like the fisherman you see with all of the fancy poles and the fancy boat yet never fishes. I spend a lot of time thinking about writing stories but I don't do a lot of writing. The bit of stuff I do have, I'll post here. I'm sorry it's not more.

Twitter is not a good way to contact me. I'll go days without checking it. :)
