Most of my stories are available at [storm-artists.net](http://epochwolf.storm-artists.net). I'm slowly moving them here. Any stories with especially voilent or sexual content will be prefixed with [nsfw]. I don't think I have more than one or two of those. 

I have three main universes my stories exist in: a fantasy universe, a science fiction universe, and a furry universe. Most of my stories take place in on of these three universes. For example: my two major furry stories (*Tempest* and "A Lack of Immunity") take place in the same universe. It's unlikely that Tempest and David will ever meet but they could.

If you don't know what a furry is, go [here](/pages/what-is-a-furry).

## Fantasy Universe: Kingdom of Zergon

The Kingdom of Zergon is a small nation constisting of a single city deep in the mountains. To the west there is an ocean and sea ports. The sea ports have poor farming and rely on trade for most of their food supply. To the east is a large kingdom the size of modern Germany. This kingdom is ruled by a king and a Church.

## Science Fiction Universe

There are 4 main species in this universe. Alien races are rare. There is no reliable FTL communication other than small courier ships. It can take weeks to travel between planets and months to cross the Terrian Alliance. 


**Terrans**

Humans. They control the majority of the worlds in the known universe. They have at least 40 colonies they are aware of and 3 core worlds other than Earth.

**Drakendoth**

Reptilian, bipedal. They are a minor species in the Terran Alliance. They control 5 colonies and their homeworld. They can be found on several Terran colonies and all of the core worlds as equal citizens.

**Meeleks**

Similar in appearence and size to a Canadian Lynx. Not a member of the Terrian Alliance. They are hidden away in a dangerous region of space known as the Deep Abyss. They are genetically enginneered and a remenedant of a vast empire which ceased to exist many millenia ago. They have access to advanced technology but have limited understanding of it.

**Lunilaw**

Bipedal wolves. Ruled by a committee of 60 clans lend by matriarchs. A small number of the population is telepathic. Not a member of the Terrian Alliance. They have limited spacefaring capablitiy with short ranged FTL. They can be found on their homeworld and some have been exiled to a human colony that the Terrans lost contact with.

## Furry Universe

I never bothered to define this universe very well. Some versions of it have humans and others don't. The species of furry that can appear vary from story to story.
