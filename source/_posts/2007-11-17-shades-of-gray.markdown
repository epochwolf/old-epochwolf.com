## Context

This poem was for a story that was never written. Here's the story in short: Everett Suarez was a Historian and Monk during the Third World War. He wrote it while he was working as a medical technician and chaplain for the Canadian Army.

## The Poem

Visions of black and white,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but all I see is gray.  
Torn flags and black blood,   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white clothes in parley.  

Mercy's lost cause dies,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon heartless beaches.  
Compassion lays shattered,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in writs and speeches.  

Abandon this world mine:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hopes, dreams, and whispered praise,  
Honest glory, meaningful honor,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgotten these dark days.  

Just need one final try,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring meaning to faith.  
There is nothing foreknown,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what I see is faint.
