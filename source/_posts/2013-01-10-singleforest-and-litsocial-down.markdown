I had to disable singleforest.com and staging.litsocial.com. There's a extremely [bad security bug](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-security/61bkgvnSGTQ/discussion) in rails I haven't had time to patch. The bug is already in metasploit which means an automated attack could compromise my servers. 

I'll be working over the weekend to patch my applications. I have several applications at my current job that are going to need emergency patches.
